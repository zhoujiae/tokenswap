      title3:'TokenSwap recently reached cooperation with other blockchain ecosystems, such as Hecochain (backed by Huobi), which enables various crypto assets on different chains to be safely transferred to TokenSwap for OTC block trades, in a fast and low-cost way.',
      des:'Take Hecochain as an example: Mike intends to swap 100,000DOT (DOT is supported by Hecochain). OTC will be the best choice considering the efficiency and minimization of price impact. Mike could firstly deposit DOT into Huobi, switch wallet network to Hecochain, withdraw HDOT to the wallet and lastly create an auction pool on TokenSwap，which helps eliminate credit risk by removing third-parties.'
